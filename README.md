## Industry Trends

* Wealth management continues to evolve as discount brokers and robo-advisors try to move ‘up market’ into financial advice and private banks try to move ‘down market’ from the ultra-high-net-worth, setting their sights on a broader swath of the end-consumer market.
* Fee pressure, digital advice and regulations add to the burden advisors and firms have to be profitable.
* According to the 2019 InvestmentNews Advisor Technology Study, top-performing advice firms evaluate their technology more frequently and focus more on the impact that technology has on productivity and profitability. These firms place greater importance on technology that improves client experiences through more personalized advice, better outcomes and more effective marketing efforts.

    * Direct competitor Plaid was acquired by Visa in Jan 2020 for $5.3Bn (~35x TEV/Revenue).
* The sale of Yodlee will allow the company to take advantage of high valuations in the space and focus on legacy competencies, sending a positive signal to the investor community.
