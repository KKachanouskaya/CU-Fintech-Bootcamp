## Landscape / Industry Trends:

* Wealth management continues to evolve as discount brokers and robo-advisors try to move ‘up market’ into financial advice and private banks try to move ‘down market’ from the ultra-high-net-worth, setting their sights on a broader swath of the end-consumer market.
* Fee pressure, digital advice and regulations add to the burden advisors and firms have to be profitable and maintain profit margin.
* According to the 2019 InvestmentNews Advisor Technology Study, top-performing advice firms evaluate their technology more frequently and focus more on the impact that technology has on productivity and profitability. These firms place greater importance on technology that improves client experiences through more personalized advice, better outcomes and more effective marketing efforts.
